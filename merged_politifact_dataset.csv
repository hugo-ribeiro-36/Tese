 The Rothschild family banking business has had an office in Russia since the 1990s, but it has no oversight over the country’s currency or monetary policies, which are controlled by the Bank of Russia. 
 The Rothschild family long has been the target of conspiracy theories, and their wealth is believed to be responsible for inspiring the anti-Semitic trope that Jewish people “control” the world’s money.
